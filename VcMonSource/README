VCMON

This is the VCMon application. This top-level directory contains the
source to VCMON.EXE, which is the win32 gui. The VXD subdirectory contains 
the source for VCMON.VXD.

There are two ways to run VCMon. If you would like statistics to be
gathered from the time that Windows starts, place the following line
in the [386Enh] section of your system.ini file:

	device=<THISDIR>\vxd\vcmon.vxd

where THISDIR is the full path to the directory containing this readme.

If you are not concerned with seeing cummulated stats from the start
of Windows, then run VCMon as a dynamic VxD. To do this simply start 
VCMON.EXE with the current directory set to this directory. In this case
statistics will reflect only results from the time VCMON was started.

The VCMon gui was compiled with MSVC++ 2.0 with added custom controls
(see the MS Knowledge Base for adding Windows 95 custom controls to VC 2.0).

The VCMon vxd was compiled with VtoolsD 2.0 for Windows 95, VC 2.0 and
Nu-Mega Technologies Soft-ICE debugger.
